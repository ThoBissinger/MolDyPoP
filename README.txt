Welcome to MolDyPoP!
This is a simulation environment for polar particles. It features Hamiltonian polar particles as well as active matter like the Vicsek model. This simulation package was created during my PhD research with Matthias Fuchs at the University of Konstanz. The way the material is presented here is mainly for a future researcher picking up where I left it, including input files that work on the SCC cluster. Some automated code may not work if the network architecture of the SCC cluster changes.
Feel free to peruse at leisure. There is a systemic documentation and short guide on how to pull off the example code (that one requries SCC access - if you don't have that, you can still run the job_loop.sh script and manually execute some of the code).

# Documentation and how to get started
There are two formulations of the documentation, one in html, one in tex/pdf. Choose which you prefer:

A. Open MolDyPoP/doxygen/html/index.html
B. Open MolDyPoP/doxygen/refman.pdf or if it doesn't exist, open MolDyPoP/doxygen/refman.tex and compile

Option A gives you the html documentation, which is recommended. From there, you should find all necessary information

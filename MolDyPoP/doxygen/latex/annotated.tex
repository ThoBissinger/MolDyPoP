\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classtopology_1_1angle2d}{topology\+::angle2d}} \\*A (double-\/valued) angle in 2d space with the possibility of identifying it with its corresponding \doxylink{classtopology_1_1_vector2d}{Vector2d} unit vector. In the current state of the simulation, this is redundant }{\pageref{classtopology_1_1angle2d}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classgroup}{group}} \\*A group of polar particles. Stores vectors with particle positions, velocities, spin orientations and spin rotation velocity, as well as further group properties }{\pageref{classgroup}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classintegrator}{integrator}} \\*Defines various integration methods for groups. Also includes thermostats. Integrators include\+: fourth order Runge-\/\+Kutta (rk4) and Leapfrog (lf) }{\pageref{classintegrator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list}} \\*Defines the \doxylink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list} class. Can be used to extract all information about neighborhood in a group, that is the neighbor pairs and all the distances. Neighbors are those other particles within the cutoff radius or the nearest neighbors in case of a lattice system }{\pageref{classneighbor__list}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classparameters}{parameters}} \\*Contains the run parameters of a simulation }{\pageref{classparameters}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classpartition}{partition}} \\*Defines the partition class. The simulation box is partitioned into cells. The indices of a vector of particles (used for initialization) are sorted according to the cell they belong to. Has functions for printing and computing average velocities in a neighborhood }{\pageref{classpartition}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classsampler}{sampler}} \\*Stores and handles all data sampling performed during a run or in a later diagnostic }{\pageref{classsampler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classtopology_1_1_vector2d}{topology\+::\+Vector2d}} \\*Mathematical 2d vectors. Can be added, multiplied by a scalar, norm computation is possible. There are print-\/to-\/file and print-\/to-\/command-\/line functions available }{\pageref{classtopology_1_1_vector2d}}{}

\doxysubsubsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Defines the \doxylink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list} class. Can be used to extract all information about neighborhood in a group, that is the neighbor pairs and all the distances. Neighbors are those other particles within the cutoff radius or the nearest neighbors in case of a lattice system. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}


\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header-\/file to class declaration of \doxylink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list}. Introduces a data structure storing the neighbors to each particle. Useful when neighborhoods stay static. 

Works especially well for disordered XY models and the like. Can also be used for lattice-\/based models, though the memory access for calls to the \doxylink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list} may be more expensive than the straightforward modulo calculations associated with neighbor calculations in lattice-\/based simulations

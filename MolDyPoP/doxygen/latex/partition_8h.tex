\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classpartition}{partition}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Defines the partition class. The simulation box is partitioned into cells. The indices of a vector of particles (used for initialization) are sorted according to the cell they belong to. Has functions for printing and computing average velocities in a neighborhood. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}


\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header-\/file to class declaration of partition. Introduces the partition, a cell list data structure that greatly facilitates neighbor calculation. 

The partition is the preferred method for neighborhood calculation. The class \doxylink{classneighbor__list}{neighbor\+\_\+list} is an alternative, but not recommended when neighborhoods change dynamically in each time step.
